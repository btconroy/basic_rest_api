# Basic REST API using Vanilla JS
A simple rest api with a single page for the front end that uses vanilla JS.
- Node.js version 18.14.0
- Nodemon version 2.0.20 
- Bootstrap version 5.0

## Why would anyone do this?
Well, to put it simply, some people like chocolate, others like vanilla. Using JS without any libraries is the best way to do this. Plus, I like vanilla... JavaScript. 

## Note:
This is a basic REST API, which means it's a CRUD application. No more, no less.
