# Basic REST API using Vanilla JS
A simple rest api with a single page for the front end that uses vanilla JS.

### Node.js version 18.14.0
### Nodemon version 2.0.20 

## Why would anyone do this?
Well, to put it simply, I feel it best to know how far I can go with what I know and learn how to make better choices when coding. Using JS without any libraries is the best way to do this. 

Plus, in the years that I have been programming, I've never went this length to know my limitations. And, clearly, this project has demonstrated where I need to perfect my coding skills. 

## Note:
This is a basic REST API, which means I am only going as far as making it a CRUD application. No more, no less.
